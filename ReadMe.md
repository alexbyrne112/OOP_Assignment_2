This game I made is based on the Call of Duty game Nazi ZOmbies
I decideed to do a top down version of the Game with different functions.

Controls:
* 'w' up
* 's' down
* 'a' left
* 'd' right
* 'space' shoot
* 'e' interact


in the top left you have juggernog. you go into the square and press 'e' to buy health and on the top left you have ammo cola
you go in to this square and press 'e' to get more ammo. Each perk costs $3000 so you must get a this before purchasing by killing enemies.
player enemy and bullet are an extension of the game object class and i used polymorphism to spawn multiple enemies.
the grass in the background of the gameplay was tricky but using the wind variables and the method i got the grass to work how I liked.
health ammo money and points are displayed on the gameplay screen and kills points and money are displayed on the end screen.
the end screen has two buttons. one to restart and one to exit.
